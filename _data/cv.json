      "name": "Should Value-Added Models Weight All Students Equally? (Job Market Paper)",
      "summary": "Conventional value-added (VA) models estimate teacher quality as a simple average of the difference between students' actual and predicted standardized test scores. These models therefore implicitly assume it is just as important to raise test scores of lower-achieving students as it is to raise test scores of higher-achieving students. I consider whether a weighted average of residuals might be more useful. Using data from North Carolina, I find that teacher VA measures become more predictive of teachers' long-run impacts when the highest-achieving students are weighted more than the median student. Strikingly, even impacts on low-achieving students' long-run outcomes are best predicted by increasing the weight on impacts on high-achieving students' short-run outcomes. These differences in weights may reflect that either (i) in small samples some students are more informative about a teacher's overall VA than others or (ii) test-score effects for different students capture different aspects of teaching, and some of these aspects are more informative than others. I find empirical evidence supporting both explanations. In particular, the large weights for high-achieving students are partially but not completely explained by the fact that their residuals are less noisy."

      "releaseDate": "2025",
      "website": "http://casetatro.github.io/files/Red_blue_mortality_gap.pdf",
      "summary": "Abstract: Age-adjusted mortality rates are higher in “red” states, i.e., states with high support for the Republican Party. We ask whether this is due to state-level policies or simply due to confounding variables such as culture. We implement three research designs: a border county design, a regression discontinuity design, and a novel design exploiting the partisanship of distant parts of a state. Our point estimates suggest that Democratic state government slightly decreases mortality, but most estimates are insignificant, and in all designs we find that the correlation between partisanship and mortality is predominantly driven by confounding."

      "website": "http/CaseTatro.github.io/files/Red_Blue_Achievemet_Gap_Draft.pdf",
      "summary": "Abstract: In the US, the general consensus is that Democrats exhibit greater support for education, including funding education more generously. Consistent with this fact, students in Democratic states score higher on standardized tests than Republican states. I implement two research designs and ask whether Democrats cause these differences in test scores through state-level policy. I find that Democrats do seem to increase test scores, although my estimates are imprecisely estimated. Further, despite the view that Democrats promote equity in education, I do not find that Democrats close achievement gaps between white and black students, male and female students, or rich and poor students."

      "name": "How does advice change when the advisor can be punished? A lab experiment.",
      "summary": "Abstract: In the US, consulting companies like McKinsey rarely face direct public accountability for their role in the firm behavior of their clients. This often allows firms to offload culpability onto their advisors. We use a simplified lab-experiment to investigate how such public accountability for advisors may change i) the type of advice consulting companies offer to firms and ii) the actions of firms. We find such accountable advice affects both the advice given by advisors and the action taken by firms. Work is ongoing regarding how accountable advice affects total welfare, but our results suggest that ultimately holding consulting companies accountable for the actions of their clients may improve consumer welfare."
