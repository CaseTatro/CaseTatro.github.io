abstract: "Conventional value-added (VA) models estimate teacher quality as a simple average of the difference between students' actual and predicted standardized test scores. These models therefore implicitly assume it is just as important to raise test scores of lower-achieving students as it is to raise test scores of higher-achieving students. I consider whether a weighted average of residuals might be more useful. Using data from North Carolina, I find that teacher VA measures become more predictive of teachers' long-run impacts when the highest-achieving students are weighted more than the median student. Strikingly, even impacts on low-achieving students' long-run outcomes are best predicted by increasing the weight on impacts on high-achieving students' short-run outcomes. These differences in weights may reflect that either (i) in small samples some students are more informative about a teacher's overall VA than others or (ii) test-score effects for different students capture different aspects of teaching, and some of these aspects are more informative than others. I find empirical evidence supporting both explanations. In particular, the large weights for high-achieving students are partially but not completely explained by the fact that their residuals are less noisy."
