Welcome! Below are links to my course materials for classes I have taught or I am currently teaching.
For other instructional staff, feel free to use any materials! I do not post solutions to my homeworks online.
For students, these materials are the same ones I have posted to Brightspace. This is simply a backup in case Brightspace has issues!
