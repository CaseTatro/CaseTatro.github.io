  <p>
    I love teaching and I care deeply about teaching. Regardless of whether I am the instructor or a teaching assistant (TA), I want my students to think critically and apply rather than regurgitate knowledge. I care about all students, not just those who get Aâ€™s. I spend more time on teaching than anyone I know. The reasons I want to spend the extra time teaching are i. I care about my students and ii. I simply enjoy it.
