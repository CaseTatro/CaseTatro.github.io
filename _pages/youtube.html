    I run a YouTube channel (@InCaseofEconStruggles) about economics. I cover microeconomics and macroeconomics at the intro/high-school AP, college, and graduate level in addition to econometrics and causal inference videos. I also have videos about how to use Stata including how to export results to Latex automatically.

    As of April 2024, I have over 2200 subscribers, 6300 hours of watch time, and 230,00 views. I post new videos every week.
