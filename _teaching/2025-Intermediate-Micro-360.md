### General Structure of the Course
I teach Intermediate Microeconomic Theory using an active, student-centered approach. The structure of my class is as follows:
* Students have an assigned reading from slides to complete before we start a topic in class.
    * Students have 3 attempts to take a 5-question true/false and multiple choice quiz due before the start of class.
        * Class time is devoted to reviewing the quiz and key ideas from the slides.
        * The rest of class is used to push topics and work on problems in small groups.
* The homeworks in my class are graded for completion, but I give feedback as if the grade is for correctness.
    * This includes providing detailed solutions with point-breakdowns for each homework available after the due date.
    * My homeworks follow the same format as my exams in order to reduce test anxiety.    

## Textbook I base the class off of.
I base this class off of Varian's textbook on Intermediate Microeconomics.
This class is calculus based, but of course could be taught in a similar manner without the calculus.
