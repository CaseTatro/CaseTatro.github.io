Below are the materials I use to teach an undergraduate intro to Environmental Economics course. This course does not require Intermediate Microeconomics nor does it require calculus. Instead, I review and build on the ideas of externalities and use both conceptual examples and experiments in class in order for students to understand the basic concepts used in enviornmental economics. The final project in this class requires students to come up with a game for their classmates to play in order to highlight a particular policy and a positive or negative consequence of that policy.

Students, below are the same materials I have posted to Brightspace in case Brightspace has any issues!
